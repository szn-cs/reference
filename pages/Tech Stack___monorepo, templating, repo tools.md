# Scripting  & Monorepo task execution pipelining tools & build systems :
	- considerations:
		- ***m***anagement, ***o***rganization, ***o***rchestration
		- task runner; Monorepo management tool
	- unmaintained [GitHub - DanielKeep/cargo-script: Cargo script subcommand](https://github.com/DanielKeep/cargo-script)
	- [GitHub - igor-petruk/scriptisto: A language-agnostic "shebang interpreter" that enables you to write scripts in compiled languages.](https://github.com/igor-petruk/scriptisto?tab=readme-ov-file)
	- library [GitHub - matklad/xshell](https://github.com/matklad/xshell)
	- üëç rust-script [GitHub - fornwall/rust-script: Run Rust files and expressions as scripts without any setup or compilation step.](https://github.com/fornwall/rust-script): most mature with more features.
	- library [GitHub - rust-shell-script/rust_cmd_lib: Common rust command-line macros and utilities, to write shell-script like tasks in a clean, natural and rusty way](https://github.com/rust-shell-script/rust_cmd_lib)
	- RFC for cargo script command that executes rust as bash script [Tracking Issue for cargo-script RFC 3424 ¬∑ Issue #12207 ¬∑ rust-lang/cargo](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/12207)
	- Werf for Kubernetes [GitHub - werf/werf: A solution for implementing efficient and consistent software delivery to Kubernetes facilitating best practices.](https://github.com/werf/werf)
	- Nx [GitHub - nrwl/nx: An AI-first build platform that connects everything from your editor to CI. Helping you deliver fast, without breaking things.](https://github.com/nrwl/nx?utm_source=monorepo.tools)
	- Turborepo [Guides | Turborepo](https://turborepo.com/docs/guides)
	- Bazel (overly complex, specific for Google scale issues)
		- Complex! simple are not trivial to achieve -> will waste a lot of time configuring the tool.
			- Because of contributor friction, Kubernetes dropped support for Bazel in their project - but still uses it somehow.
		- dependency hell problem - updating a single version can break others (requiring a chain of updates & changes which are not handled automatically).
		- With all these issues, Bazel seems to be the only tool powerful enough to cover all usecases. It also solves dependency context issues when building with skaffold & docker.
	- [A developer productivity tooling platform. | moonrepo](https://moonrepo.dev/)
	- [GitHub - moonrepo/moon: A build system and monorepo management tool for the web ecosystem, written in Rust.](https://github.com/moonrepo/moon?utm_source=monorepo.tools)
	- candidates:
		- Nx (uses Bazel internally), Moon, Bazel (Java-based, complex setup and customization, featureful);
	- wasm pluggin system [Overview | Extism - make all software programmable. Extend from within.](https://extism.org/docs/overview)
	- [Bazel modules](https://bazel.build/external/module)
	- Nx
	-
	- ## Conclusion
		- cargo workspaces, pnpm workspaces, shell scripts, rust scripts, with separate toolings like skaffold are most flexible and straight forward to implement, although their maintenance could be tedious & manual when creating new or refactoring but it is clear and easy.
			- I don't see that any monorepo manager is worth the effort. Non have complete sensible support to skaffold without requiring large config and changes;
		- Use rust scripts in each monorepo component's "script" folder, with main.rs as a REPL -like (scratchpad binary) to execute the requested commands.
-
- # Tools for repo management:
	- TODO renovate https://docs.renovatebot.com/ - updated dependencies across languages & microservices.
		- replaces dependentbot github
	- Nix flakes  - reproducable toolchains and specific version cli commands across dev environment. {{video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5D3nUU1OVx8}} - reproducable environments.
	- the Nix language is hard to learn. Is there a Rust alternative for Nix?
-
- # tools for secrets:
	- use **Mozilla SOPS** or **git-crypt** to encrypt tokens into repo.
	- use direnv in addition to dotenv as an automated way to load env into current folder.

- # Templating tool:
	- [ask llm] is there a scaffolding, code generation, or project templating tool that allows to insert bunch of configs and files to a framework project depending on which features are enabled or what components are enabled? The tool must also work by supporting to augment existing projects.
