- # Diagramming:
	- Drawio with vscode extension for .drawio.svg files. More structured diagrams.
	- Excalidraw: very good freestyle writing like rnote but can be embedded into Logseq and has vscode extension;  support for .excalidraw.svg
	- .rnote for Linux based on GTK4 not web technologies, thus less portable.
