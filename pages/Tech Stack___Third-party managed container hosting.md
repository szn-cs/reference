- Comprehensive Single Container Hosting Options with Details
	- Criteria sought for: price, features, compatibility DB, intended scale, managed containers service
		- #+BEGIN_QUOTE
		  - Criteria / Trade-offs
		  	- **Ops complexity:** PaaS < VPS < Orchestration
		  	- **Cost:** PaaS pay-per-use is best for early stage
		  	- **Integration:** ==Confirm DB or service compatibility== (Postgres, MySQL, Redis, etc.)
		  	- **Performance:** Edge or regional providers (Fly.io, Scaleway, Hetzner) can reduce latency
		  	- **Scaling path:** Kubernetes platforms support horizontal scaling and autoscaling
		  	- **Lock-in:** Proprietary PaaS platforms trade flexibility for speed
		  	- **Security:** Check compliance (SOC2, GDPR, HIPAA) for production workloads
		  	- **Monitoring:** Ensure metrics, logs, and tracing support (Prometheus, Grafana, CloudWatch)
		  	- **Cost visibility:** Always factor in storage and outbound network traffic

- _Managed / PaaS Runtimes (minimal ops)_
	- **Google Cloud Run**
	- **AWS App Runner**
	- **Azure Container Apps**
	- **Azure Container Instances (ACI)**
	- **Render**
		- cheaper, flat pricing.
	- **Fly.io**
		- "infrastructure ownership: Fly.io runs your applications on their own hardware and infrastructure"
		- autoscales vertically & horizontally; supports suspension (stops instance when not in use).

	  if the goal is minimal operations with managed containers and the cheapest price, the order to consider is:

- # Conclusion
  for simple fast low-cost apps
	- The issue with Render, Railway.app services
		- cost adds up for simple services (e.g. managed databse another 7$, ....);
		- cold-start latency issue for lower-tiers?
	- ==Fly.io==
		- has more predictable pricing (seems to be cheaper than render);
		- platform founder is transparent about cloud situation, improvement approaches and future direction.
		- issue: does not collocation database with app region.
		- proprietary container on firecracker VMs + managed kubernetes k3s + Postgresql
		- Future/vision of Fly.io is to allow LLM agent behavior and stateful apps usecases to run seamlessly with low startup time.
			- Fly.io wants to give users UX (like vercel) + great infrastructure primitives/solutions (like Amazon) for the age of AI.
		- Charges around 100% markup on its VMs (machines).
