- üëç Kafka 2011 (Java; persistent messaging; dist. event streaming pub-sub model - message broker with realtime event streaming and accompanying stream api support; durable; high throughput; realtime and async consumption supported; treats messages as logs (distributed commit logs); designed for handling huge # of messages with partitioning support in horitzontal scaling; strict ordering within partition; general for large event driven systems; more features. more advanced setup & better scalability using partitions; supports event history; fault-tolerant with leader and replica brokers through Zookeeper or Raft-based; no round-robin support instead multiple partition queues and multiple consumers can be set; monolithic tightly coupled storage & compute) [GitHub - apache/kafka: Mirror of Apache Kafka](https://github.com/apache/kafka)

	- CON: even with Strimzi Kafka operator for Kubernetes, a manual partition management is required (doesn't seamlessly scale).

- Pulsar 2016 (unlike Kafka, decouples compute from storage; less popular than Kafka; Slower than Kafka; adds support for traditional features)  has some bugs lacks maturity

- RabbitMQ 2007 (Erland; non-persistent messaging; async queue as message broker between applications; delivers messages once and removes from queue; not designed to store long term messages; designed for low latency, reliable message delivery and routing; ordering is not guaranteed once consumed; low throughput with fast message delivery but can handle less messages at a time; single message delivery; in-memory, slightly less latency; loadbalancing behavior for multiple queues; seems not to support multi-threaded and multimode scalability; more transactional where messages once consumed are intended to be deleted)

- ## Conclusions:
	- Kafka: loose coupling, async execution, log stored, fault-tolerant (leader+replicas) millions of requests/s, popular.
