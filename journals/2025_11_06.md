	- 2022: Nomad Hashicorp to run user code in a sandbox; takes care of VMs in regions; customers do not want to pay for things they do not use; Users built side projects with ephemeral start/stop nature.
		- Built Fly.io Machines: Nomad was lighter weight than Kubernetes and thus chosen over it.
		- Users wanted to scale out & run multiple instances of the app and use the database. Even run in multiple regions.
		- PaaS customer: with usually a fat app with lots of dependencies (with millions of end-users using that app). Customers wanted the Fly.io VMs platform not another new type of platform - all users had shared interest in VMs but with completely unrelated usecases and peripheral services needs (no overlap between users needs).
		- Philosophy of Fly.io followed: building cloud infrastructure with as lightweight of abstraction as possible with out enforcing design decisions and letting users maintain really low-level control;
			- shipped Machines API that permit to spin VMs.
		- Users wanted to run safe sandboxes to run arbitrary untrusted code: coincided with what Fly.io was already building.
	- 2023-2024 AI happened and the platform had to adopt but turns out users do not want to pay premium prices for GPUs.
	- ~2025: everybody building agents; Agents were now the new users, where the platform had to spin up a VM instance for every end-user to run the agent that would build a piece of code (most built apps were only run once, and then stopped for weeks, and later spun up again).
		- Users (through agents) never intended to scale the apps they were building.
		- Customers were now treating code on the VMs as state for end-users (launch a sandbox, make code changes within in a iteration loop, storing the code as state for next time).
			- no longer do customers are looking for a single app that is stateless and runs insides the VM but rather a constantly changing stateful code app.
			- Customers wanted their users to be able to run the old stateful VM they spun long time ago instantly, which is a challenge for Fly.io Machines.
		- Cusomters needed huge number of the stateful sandboxes running the VM for users on demand.
		- use-cases requirements: state that sticks around + endpoint to connect to the container + flexible  compute that spins up/down as necessary; The platform Fly.io should do this for millions of people; They expect most of it to be fast but not worried about 1% being slow.
			- Some customers were running a whole ==IDE code server==, and installing tremendous number of dependnecies - mutating code treating it as state.
				- High RAM & compute IDE + fast compute startup
			- ==dev server== - receive HTTP connection to the development server
				- Medium RAM dev server
			- MCP servers
				- low system requirement.
			- basically running ==LLM agents in a loop== that do MCP calls and some do code generation etc.
		- Local SQL and Local object storage could be very beneficial for such LLM agents use-cases.
		- Customer new features requirements: ==Checkpoints, rollbacks of state, and forks== of code
		- ==Git is not good for the whole disk back== for every change made to the filesystem.
			- git is heavy on UX which requires making lots of choices to commit.
			- maybe make the agent postpone git commit to allow user to confirm changes are what expect.
		- Having a reproducible sandbox machine for agents is a lot easier to debug, as the developer has a full picture and consistent environment even with root access of the LLM agent.
		- limitations of Fly.io Machines currently:
			- heavy starts (couple of mins) of VMs or start failing sometimes.
			- Solve state requirements using tigress buckets https://fly.io/docs/tigris/.

	- IaaS in current state is way too complicated and slows down development and hinders migration when unsupported use cases show up: VPC + Fargate/Kuberenetes + RDS + Load balancer + EBS storage volumes, etc.
	- Vercel & Heruku have a really great user experience (just like the user wants it to work).
		- But their markup percentage over the cost is high.
		- They do things untraditionally and often non-security wise.
	- Amazon built a very good infrastructure primitives but less good of UX focus.
