### TODO Research Anycast routing implementations that work on Hetzner/Kubernetes
	- Hetzner supports anycast routing by allowing users to advertise a single IP address from multiple servers. This is commonly achieved through BGP, though it typically requires owning your own Autonomous System (AS) number and IP address space. While Hetzner's infrastructure can be used for this, anycast setup requires specific network configuration, such as running your own BGP service, or using it in combination with services like Cloudflare.
		- ==Cloudflare== can be used to achieve this.
	- Fly.io supports Anycast routing for directing users to the closest sever instance.
