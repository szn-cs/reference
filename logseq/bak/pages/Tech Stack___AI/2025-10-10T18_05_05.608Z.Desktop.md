	- Model providers
		- _info:
			- _OpenRouter, DeepSeek, Ollama, Gemini, Volcengine, and SiliconFlow, etc._
			- _OpenAI-compatibe API is the standard for LLM provider support_
			- _Groq, Cerebras, and SambaNova - speed demons_
			- _Together, Fireworks, Inference, Novita, and Deepinfra;_
			- Low-latency providers are burst providers (not for large quantity of data & repetitive calls), not bulk providers; The tradeoff is between **bulk efficiency (cost/throughput)** and **Low-latency**; In addition to flexibility (model choice);
			- _LiteLLM, Kong AI Gateway, and llmgateway.io, portKey_
			  _OpenRouter  Helicone Cloud  Cloudflare AI Gateway  Eden AI  LiteLLM  Portkey  Kong AI Gateway_
				- Permits centralized control & usage managements at the gateway layer while requiring upfront integration with each provider's API credentials/billing; i.e. they do not consolidate billing for the platform gateway operator (no elastic usage but requires to setup keys for each LLM subscription).
				- Generates virtual keys for users to use and track their usage.
				- these solutions still require separate keys and subscriptions to each of the LLM providers.

	- ## Claude Code
		- info :
			- accessible through CLI or SDK.
				- thirdparty providers may allow free tier access (Google, Amazon bedrock)
			- specific phrases are mapped directly to increasing levels of thinking budget in the system: "think" < "think hard" < "think harder" < "ultrathink." Each level allocates progressively more thinking budget for Claude to use.
			- subagents allow to modify the system prompt but has shortcoming in other places.
			- Claude API pay-as-you-go is a lot more expensive  than the subscription-based when used heavily.

	- ### Conclusion
		- [[Sep 29th, 2025]] CLI comparison leads to Claude Code leading in all aspects. Use Claude Code cli + claude code router to allow additional models.
		- [[Sep 30th, 2025]] Use a combination of ((68db8148-7d49-4014-85ac-11bd9a813e84)) models with Claude Code cli
		- [[Oct 1st, 2025]] Hybrid approach:
			- previum tools like Claude Code (complex reasoning) + GLM (routine coding );
			- GLM (routine coding) + DeepSeek (reasoning) + GPT5 (additional routine & reasoning)
				- Cost effective compared to Claude Code
			- Combine 3 cheaper models: GLM 4.6 + Deepseek V3.1 Terminus ? + Kimi K2 Instruct 0905 ? + Qwen3 coder ???
			- use **LLM gateway** for user exposed interaction: OpenRouter or open-source self-hosted alternative;
				- Every single provider has reliability issues; using LLMs provider gateways prevents vendor lock-in and permits dynamically picking providers.
		- [[Oct 3rd, 2025]] Openrouter has a lot to offer. Ability to switch & test LLMs, protect billing from LLM provider (like chinease not allowing unsubscribe), unified billing, etc.

- # AI agents system design and course resources:
  collapsed:: true
	- # Agentic systems:
		- ### Workflow
			- Chaining LLMs
			- **Orchestrated workflows**: LLM divides prompt into parallel sub-tasks.
				- ![](https://www.anthropic.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-cdn.anthropic.com%2Fimages%2F4zrzovbb%2Fwebsite%2F8985fc683fae4780fb34eab1365ab78c7e51bc8e-2401x1000.png&w=3840&q=75){:height 501, :width 1088}
				- coding making complex changes to multiple files each time would benefit from orchestrator pattern where the LLM dynamically breaks down tasks, delegates to worker LLMs, and then synthesizes their results.
		- ### Agents:
			- **Agents using tools based on environmental feedback in a loop**: independent LLM operation + environment tools feedback in a loop (operates in many turns); with complex inputs, LLMs engage in reasoning & planning, then operating independently while using environment tools as ground truth to assess progress.
				- ![](https://www.anthropic.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-cdn.anthropic.com%2Fimages%2F4zrzovbb%2Fwebsite%2F58d9f10c985c4eb5d53798dea315f7bb5ab6249e-2401x1000.png&w=3840&q=75){:height 409, :width 1040}
				- # High-level flow of a coding agent
					- Agent design is effective for coding because they can iterate on solutions using test results as feedback (verifiable through automated tests); The problem space is well-defined and structured; Output quality can be measured objectively;
					- ![](https://www.anthropic.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-cdn.anthropic.com%2Fimages%2F4zrzovbb%2Fwebsite%2F4b9a1f4eb63d5962a6e1746ac26bbc857cf3474f-2400x1666.png&w=3840&q=75){:height 874, :width 1286}
				- most value for tasks that require both conversation and action, have clear success criteria, enable feedback loops, and integrate meaningful human oversight;
					- pay attention to creating good *agent*-computer interfaces (ACI i.e. tools documentation) to match models capabilities & limitations.
				- Prompts:
					- system prompt
					- Tool definitions and specifications prompt: good tool definition often includes example usage, edge cases, input format requirements, and clear boundaries from other tools.
						- write testing in https://console.anthropic.com/workbench
				- 2 principles to maintain for AI agents:
					- Share context between agents, and share full agent traces (tools called and decisions made), not just individual messages.
					  logseq.order-list-type:: number
					- Actions carry implicit decisions (each agent tasked fills gaps with assumptions), and conflicting decisions carry bad results.
					  logseq.order-list-type:: number
